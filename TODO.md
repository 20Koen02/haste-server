# TODO for OSS
* tests
* Add file extensions ourselves to push state
* Collapse CSS rules to get rid of the #key .box1 nonsense
* add feedback for errors to UI - esp. too long
* make sure file store still functions appropriately

# shared version only
* some way to do announcements easily (and use for ads)
* start using CDNs for most assets (optional)
